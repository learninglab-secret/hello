# Hi AIE Folks!
We are looking forward to getting to know you over the course of this year.
##  This Fall
### Open Studios:
Wednesdays from 5-8pm we host a studioLab dedicated to the materials and structures of our space as learning and teaching tools. You are welcome to come through and use our space and some of our resources for making. Some weeks we will have themed work or a particular goal in mind. We will update this page with any necessary information, so check back often!

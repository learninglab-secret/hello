# Notes!

## AudioPeak Project Launch Doc

### ft. Jad & Sophie & more!

Here, we'll keep track of all of our **progress** and *notes*.

> Our plan is to find a way to scrub LL video files for audio peaks, and turn those moments into GIFs, through a command line function. Those GIFs could then automatically be uploaded to an Express App for everyone to enjoy!

Steps:
1. Research relevant command line plug-ins.
2. Create the function!
3. Create an Express app to upload resulting GIFs on.
4. And, take notes the whole time!

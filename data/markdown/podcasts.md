## Models to draw from:



Hey! Check out the first 34 seconds of serial:

How can we map out the different sonic elements of these 17 seconds to develop an awareness of the podcast's complexity as a form, an understanding of its basic grammar or syntax, its repertoire of aesthetic, rhetorical, and narrative moves?

## Tools for Making Podcasts:
We generally lean towards **garageband**, as it seems to be the most widely used basic interface for our students--you may even have fond memories of recording your own songs when you were 8 years old on your first laptop which came with garageband. It's super easy to learn, and it's what we cover in many of our podcasting workshops.

If you want to try a **new online tool** that spotify recently came out with, check out [soundtrap](https://www.soundtrap.com/). It's kind of like google docs for podcasts, and allows you to collaboratively edit your project!

## Music Beds:

a [really cool site](https://www.extrememusic.com/) that lets you adjust the stems of a music bed (think adjusting the keys or the drum track in isolation to get the exact feel you're hoping for!)

Sam the podcasting wizard's favorite [music bed site](https://www.bensound.com/).

A pretty great blog on [how to effectively use music](https://blog.spreaker.com/a-complete-guide-to-adding-the-perfect-music-and-sound-effects-to-your-podcast/) in your podcast! It includes examples which are worth checking out!

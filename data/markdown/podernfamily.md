# PODERN FAMILY!
![podern family poster](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/T0HTW3H0V-FP8F7B8CW/image.png)

Trick or Treat?! It's that time of year when we are checking in with all the projects that are forming...hoping to nudge them into a place that will help us all make some really awesome things to show in our end of term Gallery!!

## Where we are at:

### Kathryn
A **dashboard** for the *learning missions* to serve as a customizable experience for llufs looking to learn something new and achieve proficiency in 1-2 mediums/tools.

### Nicole
A **d3 lab series** and an **AR Google Calendar** to develop *resources* for realityLab.

### Molly
?

### Juliana
**Blender assets** for realityLab.

### Sara
**LL intake app** intended to help incoming students find the micro-LL communities that can help them realize their project dreams.




## Project Plans in Detail:

### Mountain To Dew
#### Kathryn

**Description**
The goal of this project is to digitize the Learning Lab Mountain, a centralized dashboard for all projects, Scavenger Hunts, and other to-do’s, as well as skill-building exercises. Ideally, beyond basic functionality, we could also integrate some 3D modeling into making it a virtual experience and simulate as much actual climbing/overhead touring as possible. The more video-game-like the better!

**Rationale**
This could be especially useful to new LL Fellows as they achieve proficiency in one/two mediums, and also serve as a customizable experience for anyone looking to learn something new. This could also serve as an extension of the RealityLAb project on modeling the LL; it would be even cooler if we could somehow build a customized 3D landscape for each new iteration/learning path.

**Done**
Just getting started on tutorials for Blender! Doing research in and outside of class on building webpages.

**Doing**

*Week of October 20th:*
Review all missed realityLab tutorials and code along with some examples
Brainstorm possible website designs

*Week of October 27th:*
Establish basic functionality of mountain site
Tweak based on user feedback

*Week of November 3rd:*
Tie d3/modeling concepts in to make the site interactive

*Week of November 10th:*
Refine (as progress demands)

*Week of November 17th:*
Refine (as progress demands)

*Week of November 24th:*
Refine (as progress demands)

*Week of December 1st:*
Final touch-ups & presentation

**Community**
Would love feedback on how closely this aligns with the intended vision for this project, what could make it most user-friendly and useful to the most people, whether at or outside the Learning Lab, and any other ideas for what software I should pick up this and next week to achieve the basic goals!
Anywhere - if you want to contribute or have ideas for resources to reference or anything else, please let me know!

**Gallery**
Hopefully, the completed, interactive site!



### These are the 1s you 2 can d3!
#### Nicole

**Description**
I am going to try to make new labs for people who have never used d3 to learn how to use d3! Because I am taking 171, I have an idea of what a good curriculum order is, but being on the student side makes it pretty obvious where the downfalls are, especially if someone comes to class never having touched JS before (or, in my case, not having done so in ages)

**Rationale**
This is being developed to serve as labs for those trying to learn d3. It’ll ideally be used by those who want to make even cooler projects in d3 :)

**Done**
I’ve made visualization guides for “what looks good” for the LL, and of course any work in 171. I’m happy to share those if anyone wants to see

**Doing**
The goal is to make at least 1 lab a week for now, until I get to more difficult concepts. I’ll probably have to restructure then, but in the meantime this should be a reasonable goal.

**Community**
Honestly, having someone go through the labs as I make them (preferably someone who does have experience with coding AND someone who doesn’t) so I can see where things are unclear and I can fix them! There is a LOT of material to learn in d3, so if anyone wants to help, we could make a timeline of which labs need to be done later on so we can have one person work on making a lab for a different aspect of d3

**Gallery**
I can display the code and display the running simulation :)


### Oculus Go get organized
#### Nicole


**Description**
I roughly want to follow the steps in this guide https://medium.com/inborn-experience/how-to-build-an-app-for-the-oculus-go-from-start-to-finish-with-unity-cb72d931ddae to create an app along the lines of a Google Calendar, but more personalizable and interactive

**Rationale**
I feel like people trying to make VR/AR apps and/or unity tend to stick with games, and that ends up bringing in a lot of extra variables that can be overwhelming for someone just beginning to learn from scratch. I’m hoping by working through something a bit simpler but more likely to be used by me will help me actually learn the basics and be able to pass them along

**Done**
I haven’t done much yet other than start reading through the above link and the oculus dev stuff. I definitely want to hit up reality lab here as well as i-labs once their workshops start up!

**Doing**
I want to focus on learning C# right now (I learned a good amount from Codecademy, but definitely need a refresher), and then on the elements of Unity I need to make this project. I’ll follow the link I referenced above otherwise!

**Community**
There’s a whole reality lab going on, so if I can make those meetings or run into someone I’ll hopefully know what questions to ask when I get stuck. I’d love to have someone come to i-lab with me so I don’t go alone :); otherwise if anyone has experience with C# or making non-game displays in unity, I’d love to have them join in.
